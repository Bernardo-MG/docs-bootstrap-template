# Docs Bootstrap Template

A Bootstrap-based template for preparing documentation pages. It's meant to be used for giving a homogeneous look to documentation pages, not matter if they have been created with Maven Site, Sphinx or any other tool, and also be a bit better than the usual default template they use.

For this it makes use of Bootstrap, allowing it to adapt to most view panes, including the screens of mobile phones.

## Check it

The template can be checked at the [online demo site][demo-site]

## Usage

The template project is partly a demo, showcasing the style configuration. This means that while the static files, contained in the \_static folder, can be used as they are, the html one should be adapted, preferably with the use of a templating engine.

### Prerequisites

The project makes use of Bootstrap 3, but a modified version of it comes included, and JQuery.

Otherwise, it is just plain HTML, so any browser can be used to check it.

## Collaborate

Any kind of help with the project will be well received, and there are two main ways to give such help:

- Reporting errors and asking for extensions through the issues management
- or forking the repository and extending the project

### Issues management

Issues are managed at the GitHub [project issues tracker][issues], where any Github user may report bugs or ask for new features.
