# Docs Bootstrap Template

A Bootstrap-based template for documentation pages, offering a modern and responsive look which adapts to all screen sizes.

The project is as simple as possible, consisting just of a few static webpages, as it is meant to be used as a basis for building more complex sites by adapting it to a templating engine or documentation framework such as Jinja, Maven Site or Sphinx, but offers all the features which a documentation site could need.

## Features

- Avoids unneeded complication to ease extensions.
- HTML5 semantic markup.
- Semantic tags for Facebook OpenGraph and Twitter Cards.
- Bootstrap, Font Awesome and highlight.js.
- Validated HTML 5, accessibility, CSS and JS.

## Check it

There is an [online demo site][demo-site] available for checking the template.

It will reflect always the contents of the master branch, showing the current version of the template.

## Usage

This is a static template meant to be used as a basis for dynamic templates. For this reason most of the html files are just showcases which serve as a visual guide for several documentation features.

These pages should be adapted for the actual final template, taking into consideration that the footer and heading will be mostly the same for all the pages.

The custom style and script files are kept in the '\_static' folder, which includes also the libraries used.

### Prerequisites

The project makes use of [Bootstrap 3][bootstrap], [JQuery][jquery], [Font Awesome][font-awesome] and [highlight.js][highlightjs]. All of them come included.

Otherwise, it is just plain HTML, so any browser can be used to check it.

## Collaborate

Any kind of help with the project will be well received, and there are two main ways to give such help:

- Reporting errors and asking for extensions through the issues management
- or forking the repository and extending the project

### Issues management

Issues are managed at the GitHub [project issues tracker][issues], where any Github user may report bugs or ask for new features.

### Getting the code

If you wish to fork or modify the code, visit the [GitHub project page][scm], where the latest versions are always kept. Check the 'master' branch for the latest release, and the 'develop' for the current, and stable, development version.
