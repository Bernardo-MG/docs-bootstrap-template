# Docs Bootstrap Template

A Bootstrap-based HTML5 template for documentation pages, offering a modern and responsive look which adapts to all screen sizes and is easy to extend.

It is meant to be used as a basis for building documentation sites, and so should be adapted to a templating engine or documentation framework such as Jinja, Maven Site or Sphinx.

## Features

- Avoids unneeded complication to ease extensions.
- HTML5 semantic markup.
- Semantic tags for Facebook OpenGraph and Twitter Cards.
- Bootstrap, Font Awesome and highlight.js.
- Validated HTML 5, accessibility, CSS and JS.

## Check it

There is an [online demo site][demo-site] which always reflects the current contents of the master branch, which is the latest version of the template.

## Usage

This is static template is meant to be transformed into a dynamic one, through the use of the preferred framework.
 
For this the HTML files should be used as a basis, which will need to be adapted as much as required, and not used directly as offered.

The files contained in the '\_static' folder, which includes also the libraries used, should require little changes, but may require some corrections to adapt to any changes made.

### Prerequisites

The project makes use of [Bootstrap 3][bootstrap], [JQuery][jquery], [Font Awesome][font-awesome] and [highlight.js][highlightjs]. All of them come included in the '\_static\lib' folder.

Otherwise, it is just plain HTML5 and CSS3.
